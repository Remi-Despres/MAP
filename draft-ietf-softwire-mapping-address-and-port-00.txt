Internet-Draft                     MAP                      October 2011


1.  Introduction

   The mechanism of mapping IPv4 addresses in IPv6 address has been
   described in numerous mechanisms dating back to [RFC1933] from 1996.
   The Automatic tunnelling mechanism described in RFC1933, assigned a
   globally unique IPv6 address to a host by combining the hosts IPv4
   address with a well known IPv6 prefix.  Given an IPv6 packet with an
   destination address with an embedded IPv4 address, a node could
   automatically tunnel this packet by extracting the IPv4 tunnel end-
   point address from the IPv6 destination address.

   There are numerous variations of this idea, described in 6over4
   [RFC2529], ISATAP [RFC5214] and 6rd [RFC5969].  The differences are
   the use of well known IPv6 prefixes, or Service Provider assigned
   IPv6 prefixes, and the exact position of the IPv4 bits embedded in
   the IPv6 address.  Teredo [RFC4380] added a twist to this to achieve
   NAT traversal by also encoding transport layer ports into the IPv6
   address. 6rd to achieve more efficient encoding, allowed for only an
   IPv4 address suffix to be embedded, with the IPv4 prefix being
   deducted from other provisioning mechanisms.

   NAT-PT [RFC2766](deprecated) combined with a DNS ALG used address
   mapping to put NAT state, namely the IPv6 to IPv4 binding encoded in
   an IPv6 address.

   The commonalities of all these mechanisms are:
   o  Provisions an IPv6 address for a host or an IPv6 prefix for a site
   o  Algorithmic or implicit address resolution for tunneling or
      encapsulation.  Given an IPv6 destination address, an IPv4 tunnel
      endpoint address can be calculated.  Likewise for translation, an
      IPv4 address can be calculated from an IPv6 destination address
      and vice versa.
   o  Embedding of an IPv4 address or part thereof and optionally
      transport layer ports into an IPv6 address.

   In the later phases of IPv4 to IPv6 migration, IPv6 only networks
   will be common, while there will still be a need for residual IPv4
   deployment.  This document describes a more generic mapping of IPv4
   to IPv6 that can be used both for encapsulation (IPv4 over IPv6) and
   for translation between the two protocols.

   Just as the IPv6 over IPv4 mechanisms refered to above, the residual
   IPv4 over IPv6 mechanisms must be capable of:
   o  Provisioning an IPv4 prefix, an IPv4 address or a shared IPv4
      address.
   o  Algorithmically map between an IPv4 prefix, IPv4 address or a
      shared IPv4 address and an IPv6 address.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Terminology

   MAP domain:           A set of MAP CEs and BRs connected to the same
                         virtual link.  A service provider may deploy a
                         single MAP domain, or may utilize multiple MAP
                         domains.  Each domain requires a separate MAP
                         IPv6 prefix.
   MAP Border Relay (BR):  A MAP enabled router managed by the service
                         provider at the edge of a MAP domain.  A Border
                         Relay router has at least an IPv6-enabled
                         interface and an IPv4 interface connected to
                         the native IPv4 network.  A MAP BR may also be
                         referred to simply as a "BR" within the context
                         of MAP.
   MAP Customer Edge (CE):  A device functioning as a Customer Edge
                         router in a MAP deployment.  In a residential
                         broadband deployment, this type of device is
                         sometimes referred to as a "Residential
                         Gateway" (RG) or "Customer Premises Equipment"
                         (CPE).  A typical MPA CE adopting MAP rules
                         will serve a residential site with one WAN side
                         interface, one or more LAN side interfaces.  A
                         MAP CE may also be referred to simply as a "CE"
                         within the context of MAP.
   Shared IPv4 address:  An IPv4 address that is shared among multiple
                         CEs.  Each node has a separate part of the
                         transport layer port space.
   CE IPv6 prefix:       The IPv6 prefix assigned to a CE by other means
                         than MAP itself, and used by MAP to derive a CE
                         MAP prefix.
   CE IPv6 address:      In the context of MAP, the IPv6 address used to
                         reach the MAP function of a CE from other CE's
                         and from BR's.  The IID of this address differs
                         from that of host interface address that start
                         with the CE IPv6 prefix.
   CE MAP prefix:        The MAP prefix of the CE.  It is derived from
                         the CE IPv6 prefix by a mapping rule according
                         to Section XX.  Depending on its length, it is
                         an IPv4 prefix, an IPv4 address, or a shared
                         IPv4 address followed by a Port-set ID (Section
                         XX).

Internet-Draft                     MAP                      October 2011


   Port-set ID (PSID):   In a CE MAP prefix longer than 32 bits, bits
                         that follow the first 32.  It algorithmically
                         identifies a set of ports exclusively assigned
                         to the CE.
   Domain IPv6 prefix:   An IPv6 prefix assigned by an ISP to a MAP
                         domain.
   Domain IPv4 prefix:   A MAP prefix assigned by an ISP to the MAP
                         domain.
   IPv4 Embedded Address (EA) bits:  The IPv4 EA-bits in the IPv6
                         address identify an IPv4 prefix, IPv4 address
                         or part of IPv4 address and port set
                         identifier.

    The first half of the EA bits contain the IPv4 address, prefix
    or IPv4 suffix. The second half of the EA bits, in the case of a
    shared IPv4 address contains the PSID.

    | IPv4 prefix | IPv4 Address suffix |         |Port Set ID |
    +-------------+---------------------+         +------------+

    To create a complete IPv4 address, the IPv4 address suffix from the
    EA bits, are concatenated with a provisioned IPv4 prefix.

    The PSID bits are not a prefix, but an infix. And is used to
    create a port range.

Appendix A.  Requirements

   This list of requirements for a stateless mapping of address and
   ports solution may not be complete.  The requirements are listed in
   no particular order, and they may be conflicting.

   R-1:   The representation of an IPv4 prefix, address or shared IPv4
          address and PSID must be efficient.  As an example it must be
          possible to represent a shared IPv4 address and PSID in 24
          bits or less.  (Given a typical prefix assignment of /56 to
          the end-user and a MAP IPv6 prefix of /32.)
   R-2:   The IPv6 address format and mapping must be flexible, and
          support any placement of the embedded bits from IPv4 address
          and port set in the IPv6 address.
   R-3:   Algorithm complexity.  The mapping from an IPv4 address and
          port to an IPv6 address is done in the forwarding plane on MAP
          nodes.  It is important that the algorithm is bounded and as
          efficient as possible.
   R-4:   The mapping must at least support a sharing ratio of 64, 1024
          ports per end-user.
   R-5:   The mapping should support multiple rules to allow for
          deployments with several IPv4 subnets within the mapping
          domain.
   R-6:   The mapping may support deployments using differentiated port-
          ranges.  That is end-users are assigned different sized port-
          ranges and direct communication between MAP CEs are permitted.
   R-7:   The mapping should support differentiated port ranges within a
          single shared IPv4 address.

Internet-Draft                     MAP                      October 2011


   R-8:   The MAP solution should support excluding the well known ports
          0-1023.
   R-9:   It MUST be possible to assign well known ports to a CE.
   R-10:  There must not be any dependency between IPv6 addressing and
          IPv4 addressing.  With the exception where full IPv4 addresses
          or prefixes are encoded.  Then IPv6 prefix assignment must be
          done so that martian IPv4 addresses are not assigned.
   R-11:  The mapping must not require IPv4 routing to be imported in
          IPv6 routing.
   R-12:  The mapping should support legacy RTP/RTCP compatibility.
          (Allocating two consecutive ports).
   R-13:  The mapping may be UPnP 1.0 friendly.  A UPnP client will keep
          asking for the next port (as in current port + 1) a scattered
          port allocation will be more UPnP friendly.
   R-14:  For out of domain traffic the mapping must support embedding a
          full IPv4 address (and PSID) in the IPv6 interface identifier.
          This is required in the translation case.  It also simplifies
          pretty printing and other operational tools.
   R-15:  For Service Providers requiring to apply specific policies on
          per Address-Family (e.g., IPv4, IPv6), some provisioning tools
          (e.g., DHCPv6 option) may be required to derive in a
          deterministic way the IPv6 address to be used for the IPv4
          traffic based on the IPv6 prefix delegated to the home
          network.
   R-16:  It should/must/may be possible to use the same IPv6 prefix
          (/64) for native IPv6 traffic and MAPed traffic.
   R-17:  When only one single IPv6 prefix is assigned for both native
          IPv6 communications and the transport of IPv4 packets, the
          IPv4-translatable IPv6 prefix MUST have a length less than
          /64.  When distinct prefixes are used, this requirement is
          relaxed.
   R-18:  The same mapping must support both translation and
          encapsulation solutions.


Appendix B.  Deployment considerations

   Regarding MAP solutions, the community has granted to investigate
   encap/decap and translation for different deployment cases.  A new
   designed solutions should not impact customary behaviour on existing
   network nodes. below has listed some deployment considerations.

B.1.  Flexible Assigment of Port Range

   Different classes of customers would require port sets of different
   sizes.  In the context of shared IPv4 addresses, some customers would
   be satisfied with an shared IPv4 addresses, while others may need to
   be assigned with a single IPv4 address or delegated with IPv4

   prefixes shorter than 32 bits due to increasing traffic demands.  MAP
   would allow such flexibilities to allocate different port- set sizes
   for satisfy different demands.

B.2.  Traffic Classification

   Usually, ISPs adopt traffic classification to ensure service quality
   for different classes of customers.  This feature is also helpful for
   customer behavior monitoring and security protection. for example,
   DIA (Dedicated Internet Access) has been provided by operators for
   corporations to cater for their Internet communications needs.
   Service is made by means of the edge router features and key systems,
   like ACL(Access List Control) to classify different traffic.  Five
   tuples would be identified from IP header and UDP/TCP header.
   Currently, it is very well supported in IPv4.  Vendors are delivering
   or committed to support that feature for IPv6.  In order to
   facilitating IPv6 deployment, 4v6 solution would support this feature
   on IPv6 plane.

B.3.  Prefix Delegation Deployment

   Prefix delegation is an important feature both for broadband and
   mobile network.  In mobile network, prefix delegation is introduced
   in 3GPP network in Release 10.  The deployment of PD would be
   supported in 4v6 case.  Variable length of IPv6 prefix is assigned to
   CPE for deriving IPv4 information.

B.4.  Coexisting Deployment

   4v6 solutions(i.e. encapsulation and translation) would not only
   coexist with each other, but also can harmonize with other deployment
   cases.  Here lists some coexisting cases.  (Note: more coexisting
   cases are expected to be investigated in future.)

   o Case 1: Coexisting between 4v6 encapsulation and 4v6 translation

   o Case 2: Coexisting between 4v6 translation and NAT64 (Single
   Translation)

   o Case 3: Coexisting between 4v6 solutions and SLAAC

B.5.  Friendly to Network Provisioning

   Network management plane normally has an ability to to identify
   different users and the compatible with the address assignment
   techniques in the domain. 4v6 would conform to current practices on
   management plane.  In 3GPP network, for example, only the IPv6 prefix
   is assigned to the devices, used to identify different users.  And

   managment plane for one family address is better than two, namely the
   operating platform does not need to manage both IPv4 and IPv6.  Since
   only IPv6 prefix is assigned, 4v6 on the management plane is
   naturally conducted only via IPv6.

B.6.  Enable privacy addresses

   User privacy should be taken into account when 4v6 solution is
   deployed.  Some security concern associated with non-changing IPv6
   interface identifiers has been expressed in RFC4941[RFC4941].
   Ability to change the interface identifier over time makes it more
   difficult for eavesdroppers and other information collectors to
   identify when different addresses used in different sessions actually
   correspond to the same node.

B.7.  Facilitating 4v6 Service

   Some ISPs may need to offer services in a 4v6 domain with a shared
   address, e.g. 4v6 node hosts FTP server.  The service provisioning
   may require well-know port range(i.e. port range belong to 0-1023).
   MAP would provide operators with possibilities to generate a port
   range including the 0-1023.  Afterwards, operators could decide to
   assign it to any requesting user.

B.8.  Independency with IPv6 Routing Planning

   The IPv6 routing is easier to plan if it's not impacted by the
   encoded IPv4 or port ID information.  MAP would prohibit IPv4 routing
   imported in IPv6.

B.9.  Optimized Routing Path

   MAP could achieve optimized routing path both for hub case and mesh
   case.  Traffic in hub and spoke case could follow asymmetric routing,
   in which incoming routes would not be binded to a given border point
   but others geographically closed to traffic initiators.  In mesh
   cases, traffic between CPEs could directly communicate without going
   through remote border point.
