1.  Introduction

   The mechanism of mapping IPv4 addresses in IPv6 address has been
   described in numerous mechanisms dating back to [RFC1933] from 1996.
   The Automatic tunneling mechanism described in RFC1933, assigned a
   globally unique IPv6 address to a host by combining the hosts IPv4
   address with a well known IPv6 prefix.  Given an IPv6 packet with an
   destination address with an embedded IPv4 address, a node could
   automatically tunnel this packet by extracting the IPv4 tunnel end-
   point address from the IPv6 destination address.

   There are numerous variations of this idea, described in 6over4
   [RFC2529], ISATAP [RFC5214] and 6rd [RFC5969].  The differences are
   the use of well known IPv6 prefixes, or Service Provider assigned
   IPv6 prefixes, and the exact position of the IPv4 bits embedded in
   the IPv6 address.  Teredo [RFC4380] added a twist to this to achieve
   NAT traversal by also encoding transport layer ports into the IPv6
   address. 6rd to achieve more efficient encoding, allowed for only an
   IPv4 address suffix to be embedded, with the IPv4 prefix being
   deducted from other provisioning mechanisms.

   NAT-PT [RFC2766](deprecated) combined with a DNS ALG used address
   mapping to put NAT state, namely the IPv6 to IPv4 binding encoded in
   an IPv6 address.  This characteristic has been inherited by NAT64
   [RFC6146] and DNS64 [RFC6147] which rely on an address format defined
   in [RFC6052].  [RFC6052] specifies the algorithmic translation of an
   IPv6 address to IPv4 address suffix to be embedded, with the deducted
   from other provisioning mechanisms.  DNS ALG used address IPv4
   binding encoded in it a corresponding IPv4 address, and vice versa.
   In particular, [RFC6052] specifies the address format to build IPv4-
   converted and IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses.  RFC6052 discusses
   the transport of the port range information in an IPv4-embedded IPv6
   address but the conclusion was the following (excerpt from
   [RFC6052]):

   "There have been proposals to complement stateless translation with a
   port-range feature.  Instead of mapping an IPv4 address to exactly
   one IPv6 prefix, the options would allow several IPv6 nodes to share
   an IPv4 address, with each node managing a different range of ports.
   If a port range extension is needed, could be defined later, using
   bits currently reserved as null in the suffix."

   The commonalities of all these mechanisms are:
   o  Provisions an IPv6 address for a host or an IPv6 prefix for a site
   o  Algorithmic or implicit address resolution for tunneling or
      encapsulation.  Given an IPv6 destination address, an IPv4 tunnel
      endpoint address can be calculated.  Likewise for translation, an
      IPv4 address can be calculated from an IPv6 destination address

      and vice versa.
   o  Embedding of an IPv4 address or part thereof and optionally
      transport layer ports into an IPv6 address.

   In the later phases of IPv4 to IPv6 migration, IPv6 only networks
   will be common, while there will still be a need for residual IPv4
   deployment.  This document describes a more generic mapping of IPv4
   to IPv6 that can be used both for encapsulation (IPv4 over IPv6) and
   for translation between the two protocols.

   Just as the IPv6 over IPv4 mechanisms refereed to above, the residual
   IPv4 over IPv6 mechanisms must be capable of:
   o  Provisioning an IPv4 prefix, an IPv4 address or a shared IPv4
      address.
   o  Algorithmically map between an IPv4 prefix, IPv4 address or a
      shared IPv4 address and an IPv6 address.

3.  Terminology

   MAP domain:           A set of MAP CEs and BRs connected to the same
                         virtual link.  A service provider may deploy a
                         single MAP domain, or may utilize multiple MAP
                         domains.  When several MAP domains are
                         deployed, separate Domain IPv6 prefixes are
                         required.
   MAP Rule              A set of parameters whereby: an IPv4 prefix,
                         exclusive IPv4 address or is derived from the
                         Delegated IPv6 Prefix; And a CE IPv6 address is
                         derived from an IPv4 address plus a port.  A
                         4rd domain has one or more Mapping rules.
   MAP Border Relay (BR):  A MAP enabled router managed by the service
                         provider at the edge of a MAP domain.  A Border
                         Relay router has at least an IPv6-enabled
                         interface and an IPv4 interface connected to
                         the native IPv4 network.  A MAP BR may also be
                         referred to simply as a "BR" within the context
                         of MAP.

   MAP Customer Edge (CE):  A device functioning as a Customer Edge
                         router in a MAP deployment.  In a residential
                         broadband deployment, this type of device is
                         sometimes referred to as a "Residential
                         Gateway" (RG) or "Customer Premises Equipment"
                         (CPE).  A typical MAP CE adopting MAP rules
                         will serve a residential site with one WAN side
                         interface, one or more LAN side interfaces.  A
                         MAP CE may also be referred to simply as a "CE"
                         within the context of MAP.
   Shared IPv4 address:  An IPv4 address that is shared among multiple
                         CEs.  Each node has a separate part of the
                         transport layer port space; denoted as a port
                         set.
   IPv4 port-restricted CE  refers to aA MAP CE assigned with a shared
                         IPv4 address and a set of ports.  Only port
                         belong to the assigned range of port must be
                         used to issue IPv4 packets (forwarded using
                         IPv6 transfer capabilities in the attached MAP
                         domain).
   CE IPv6 prefix:       The IPv6 prefix assigned to a CE by other means
                         than MAP itself, and used by MAP to derive a CE
                         MAP prefix.
   CE IPv6 address:      The IPv6 address used to reach the MAP function
                         of a CE from other CE's and from BR's.
   CE MAP prefix:        The MAP prefix of the CE.  It is derived from
                         the CE IPv6 prefix by a mapping rule according
                         to Section XX.  Depending on its length, it is
                         an IPv4 prefix, an IPv4 address, or a shared
                         IPv4 address followed by a Port-set ID (Section
                         XX).
   Port-set ID (PSID):   In a CE MAP prefix longer than 32 bits, bits
                         that follow the first 32.  It algorithmically
                         identifies a set of ports exclusively assigned
                         to the CE.
   Domain IPv6 prefix:   An IPv6 prefix assigned by an ISP to a MAP
                         domain.
   Domain IPv4 prefix:   A MAP prefix assigned by an ISP to the MAP
                         domain.
   IPv4 Embedded Address (EA) bits:  The IPv4 EA-bits in the IPv6
                         address identify an IPv4 prefix, IPv4 address
                         or part of IPv4 address and port set
                         identifier.

   Domain IPv6 Prefix and Domain IPv4 Prefix.  It can be used to deduce
   the valid port set for a given CE, synthesize the full IPv4 address
   from a provisioned CE IPv6 prefix, and vice versa.

   MAP Mapping Rule consists of the following items
   o  Domain IPv6 prefix
   o  Domain IPv4 prefix
   o  Domain IPv6 prefix length
   o  BR IPv6 prefix

   In Hub and Spoke case, there is only one MAP mapping rule needed for
   CE, indicating its own IPv4/IPv6 prefixes, while BR must contain all
   MAP mapping rules for its MAP domain.  However, in mesh case, both
   CEs and BRs need to know all the mappings rules in MAP domain.

Appendix A.  Requirements

   This list of requirements for a stateless mapping of address and
   ports solution may not be complete.  The requirements are listed in
   no particular order, and they may be conflicting.

   R-1:   To allow for a single user delegated IPv6 prefix to be used
          for native IPv6 service and for MAP, the representation of an
          IPv4 prefix, address or shared IPv4 address and PSID must be
          efficient.  As an example it must be possible to represent a
          shared IPv4 address and PSID in 24 bits or less.  (Given a

Internet-Draft                     MAP                      October 2011


          typical prefix assignment of /56 to the end-user and a MAP
          IPv6 prefix of /32.)
   R-2:   The IPv6 address format and mapping must be flexible, and
          support any placement of the embedded bits from IPv4 prefix/
          address and port set in the IPv6 address.
   R-3:   Algorithm complexity.  The mapping from an IPv4 address and
          port to an IPv6 address is done in the forwarding plane on MAP
          nodes.  It is important that the algorithm is bounded and as
          efficient as possible.
   R-4:   MAP must allow service providers to define their own address
          sharing ratio.  MAP MUST NOT in particular restrict by design
          the possible address sharing ratio; ideally 1:1 and 1:65536
          should be supported.  The mapping must at least support a
          sharing ratio of 64, 1024 ports per end-user.
   R-5:   The mapping may support deployments using differentiated port-
          ranges.  That is, end-users are assigned different sized port-
          ranges and direct communication between MAP CEs are permitted.
   R-6:   The mapping should support differentiated port ranges within a
          single shared IPv4 address. (i.e., be able to assign port
          ranges of different sizes to customers without requiring any
          per customer state to be instantiated in network elements
          involved in data transfer).
   R-7:   The MAP solution should support excluding the well known ports
          0-1023.
   R-8:   It MUST be possible to assign well known ports to a CE.
   R-9:   There must not be any dependency between IPv6 addressing and
          IPv4 addressing.  With the exception where full IPv4 addresses
          or prefixes are encoded.  Then IPv6 prefix assignment must be
          done so that martian IPv4 addresses are not assigned.
   R-10:  The mapping must not require IPv4 routing to be imported in
          IPv6 routing.
   R-11:  The mapping should support legacy RTP/RTCP compatibility.
          (Allocating two consecutive ports).
   R-12:  The mapping may be UPnP 1.0 friendly.  A UPnP client will keep
          asking for the next port (as in current port + 1) a scattered
          port allocation will be more UPnP friendly.
   R-13:  For out of domain traffic the mapping must support embedding a
          full IPv4 address (and PSID) in the IPv6 interface identifier.
          This is required in the translation case.  It also simplifies
          pretty printing and other operational tools.
   R-14:  For Service Providers requiring to apply specific policies on
          per Address-Family (e.g., IPv4, IPv6), some provisioning tools
          (e.g., DHCPv6 option) may be required to derive in a
          deterministic way the IPv6 address to be used for the IPv4
          traffic based on the IPv6 prefix delegated to the home
          network.

Internet-Draft                     MAP                      October 2011


   R-15:  It should/must/may be possible to use the same IPv6 prefix
          (/64) for native IPv6 traffic and MAPed traffic.
   R-16:  When only one single IPv6 prefix is assigned for both native
          IPv6 communications and the transport of IPv4 packets, the
          IPv4-translatable IPv6 prefix MUST have a length less than
          /64.  When distinct prefixes are used, this requirement is
          relaxed.
   R-17:  The same mapping must support both translation and
          encapsulation solutions.


Appendix B.  Deployment considerations

   Regarding MAP solutions, the community has granted to investigate
   encap/decap and translation for different deployment cases.  A new
   designed solutions should not impact customary behavior on existing
   network nodes. below has listed some deployment considerations.

B.1.  Flexible Assigment of Port Range

   Different classes of customers would require port sets of different
   sizes.  In the context of shared IPv4 addresses, some customers would
   be satisfied with an shared IPv4 addresses, while others may need to
   be assigned with a single IPv4 address or delegated with IPv4
   prefixes shorter than 32 bits due to increasing traffic demands.  MAP
   would allow such flexibilities to allocate different port- set sizes
   for satisfy different demands.

B.2.  Traffic Classification

   Usually, ISPs adopt traffic classification to ensure service quality
   for different classes of customers.  This feature is also helpful for
   customer behavior monitoring and security protection. for example,
   DIA (Dedicated Internet Access) has been provided by operators for
   corporations to cater for their Internet communications needs.
   Service is made by means of the edge router features and key systems,
   like ACL(Access List Control) to classify different traffic.  Five
   tuples would be identified from IP header and UDP/TCP header.
   Currently, it is very well supported in IPv4.  Vendors are delivering
   or committed to support that feature for IPv6.  In order to
   facilitating IPv6 deployment, 4v6 solution would support this feature
   on IPv6 plane.

B.3.  Prefix Delegation Deployment

   Prefix delegation is an important feature both for broadband and
   mobile network.  In mobile network, prefix delegation is introduced
   in 3GPP network in Release 10.  The deployment of PD would be



Troan                    Expires April 26, 2012                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                     MAP                      October 2011


   supported in 4v6 case.  Variable length of IPv6 prefix is assigned to
   CPE for deriving IPv4 information.

B.4.  Coexisting Deployment

   4v6 solutions(i.e. encapsulation and translation) would not only
   coexist with each other, but also can harmonize with other deployment
   cases.  Here lists some coexisting cases.  (Note: more coexisting
   cases are expected to be investigated in future.)

   o Case 1: Coexisting between 4v6 encapsulation and 4v6 translation

   o Case 2: Coexisting between 4v6 translation and NAT64 (Single
   Translation)

   o Case 3: Coexisting between 4v6 solutions and SLAAC

B.5.  Friendly to Network Provisioning

   Network management plane normally has an ability to to identify
   different users and the compatible with the address assignment
   techniques in the domain. 4v6 would conform to current practices on
   management plane.  In 3GPP network, for example, only the IPv6 prefix
   is assigned to the devices, used to identify different users.  And
   management plane for one family address is better than two, namely
   the operating platform does not need to manage both IPv4 and IPv6.
   Since only IPv6 prefix is assigned, 4v6 on the management plane is
   naturally conducted only via IPv6.

B.6.  Enable privacy addresses

   User privacy should be taken into account when 4v6 solution is
   deployed.  Some security concern associated with non-changing IPv6
   interface identifiers has been expressed in RFC4941[RFC4941].
   Ability to change the interface identifier over time makes it more
   difficult for eavesdroppers and other information collectors to
   identify when different addresses used in different sessions actually
   correspond to the same node.

B.7.  Facilitating 4v6 Service

   Some ISPs may need to offer services in a 4v6 domain with a shared
   address, e.g. 4v6 node hosts FTP server.  The service provisioning
   may require well-know port range(i.e. port range belong to 0-1023).
   MAP would provide operators with possibilities to generate a port
   range including the 0-1023.  Afterwards, operators could decide to
   assign it to any requesting user.

Internet-Draft                     MAP                      October 2011


B.8.  Independency with IPv6 Routing Planning

   The IPv6 routing is easier to plan if it's not impacted by the
   encoded IPv4 or port ID information.  MAP would prohibit IPv4 routing
   imported in IPv6.

B.9.  Optimized Routing Path

   MAP could achieve optimized routing path both for hub case and mesh
   case.  Traffic in hub and spoke case could follow asymmetric routing,
   in which incoming routes would not be binded to a given border point
   but others geographically closed to traffic initiators.  In mesh
   cases, traffic between CPEs could directly communicate without going
   through remote border point.

                         and its succeeding extensions (or updates) for
                         port-space sharing

C.2.  Understanding address formats: their difference and relevance

   It is important for an operator to understand what the MAP is
   designed for and where it could be applied.

   MAP introduces an address format of embedding IPv4 information to
   IPv6 address.  On the other hand, we also have [RFC6052] defines an
   address format with the similar property.  With extending port-set
   id, it can also support address sharing among different CEs
   [I-D.xli-behave-divi].  What are their differences and relations?

   Why is it needed to code the IPv4 prefix?

   Precisely speaking, it is not "to compress the IPv4 prefix" but "to
   establish correspondence between IPv6 delegated prefixes and the
   residual IPv4 prefixes."

   MAP is designed for IPv4 residual deployment, which refers to
   efficiently applying residual (not-yet-assigned) IPv4 addresses in
   response to IPv4 communication demands of the IPv6 network in
   deployment.  Therefore, the delegated CE prefixes are determined
   prior to finding proper IPv4 address blocks in hand to be mapped to
   the CE index and the IPv4 prefix index as well as the Rule IPv6
   prefix, respectively.

   Because the IPv6 delegation planning is independent of the IPv4
   addressing, the /64 prefix is a canonical configuration for all IPv6
   local network.  It is highly impossible to directly match some IPv4
   prefixes to the already-determined IPv6 prefixes, and therefore the
   prefixes have to be coded and typically it is a compression.

   If we have a short-enough Common Prefix, it is also possible to
   deploy a direct matching where 4pfx is equal to IPv4 prefix.  Only in
   this case, the MAP format is as same as the RFC6052 format and the

   rule set could be simplified to a unique rule for 0.0.0.0/0.

   Why does MAP copy IPv4 address in the suffix?

   The full IPv4 address copied in the suffix plays auxiliary roles.

   Although the compression makes full IPv4 address not directly appear
   in the IPv6 address, the delegated prefix is sufficient to extract
   the corresponding IPv4 address for the CE.  However, this relies on
   the distribution of rules.  Embedding the full IPv4 address again in
   the suffix helps simple processing at IPv6-to-IPv4 translator when
   utilizing MAP for double translation.  It also helps in setting
   filters at middle boxes, with exposing the IPv4 full addresses
   dispatched to the CEs.

   Although MAP is designed for the residual deployment, it is also
   suitable for the objective of providing stateless encapsulation or
   double translation for the ever deployed IPv4 networks whose provider
   backbone has upgraded to IPv6.  However, unlike the residual
   deployment, the latter case needs to introduce IPv4 routing entropy
   into the IPv6 routing infrastructure.

C.3.  A generic logic of working with MAP

   This section illustrate how we can use MAP in the operation of
   residual deployment.  It starts from IPv6 address planning.

   (A) IPv6 considerations (A1) Determine the maximum number N of CEs to
   be supported, and, for generality, suppose N = 2^n.  (A2) Choose the
   length x of IPv6 prefixes to be assigned to ordinary customers (e.g.,
   x = 60).  (A3) Multiply N by a margin coefficient K, a power of two
   (K = 2 ^ k), to take into account that: - Some privileged customers
   may be assigned IPv6 prefixes of length x', shorter than x, to have
   larger addressing spaces than ordinary customers, both in IPv6 and
   IPv4. - Due to the hierarchy of routable prefixes, many theoretically
   delegatable prefixes may not be actually delegatable (ref: host
   density ratio of [RFC3194]).  (B) IPv4 considerations (B1) List all
   (non overlapping, not yet assigned to any in-running networks) IPv4
   prefixes Hi that are available for IPv4 residual deployment.  (B2)
   Take enough of them, among the shortest ones, to get a total space
   whose size M is a power of two (M = 2 ^ m), and includes a good
   proportion of the available IPv4 space.  If the M < N, addresses
   should be shared by N CEs and thus each is shared by N/M = 2^(n - m)
   CEs with PSID length of (n - m).  (B3) For each IPv4 prefix Hi of
   length hi, choose a "rule index", i.e., the 4pfx in Fig.C-1 and
   Fig.C-3, say Ri of length ri = m - (32 - hi).  All these indexes must
   be non overlapping prefixes (e.g. 0, 10, 110, 111 for one /10, one
   /11, and two /12).  (C) After (A) and (B), deriving the rule(s) (C1)

   Derive the length c of the "Common prefix" C that will appear at the
   beginning of all delegated prefixes (c = x - (n + k)).  (C2) Take any
   prefix for this C of length c that starts with a RIR-allocated IPv6
   prefix.  (C3) For each IPv4 prefix Hi, make a rule, in which the key
   is Hi, and the value is the Common prefix C followed by the Rule
   index Ri.  Then this i-th rule's Rule IPv6 Prefix will have the
   length of (c + ri).

   If different sharing ratio is expected, we may partition all CEs into
   subsets and do (A) and (B) for each subset, determining the PSID
   length for them separately.

   NOTE: Applying MAP for the operation other than residual deployment
   (e.g., the IPv6 mapping for already-deployed old IPv4 CEs and
   subnets) can reference the above text but please pay attention to the
   differences in prerequisites and demands.  The condition for the
   deployment feasibility is possibly different.
