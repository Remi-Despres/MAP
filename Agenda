   - Domain IPv4/IPv6 prefix versus MAP domain?  "One MAP domain
   consists of a set of MAP BRs and CEs, that share a single Domain
   IPv6 prefix. Within each MAP domain there can be multiple mapping
   rules shared by all MAP nodes. The mapping rules consist of a Rule
   IPv4 prefix Rule IPv6 prefix, and Port mapping parameters"
   - Address vs Prefix vs Both?

Open issues:
 1) Address format & Interface identifier:
    o Need for a parseable interface-id?
    o "L" field?
    o PSID full port in interface-id?
    o Magic bits? (V/U)
    o Placement of IPv4 address
 2) Same /64 for native and for MAP?
 3) Well known ports
 4) Port mapping algorithm choice

Question: Is the draft ready for revision-00? If not, what changes are
          required?

Discuss: How to most efficiently work together for a revision 01, by next
         Monday.
